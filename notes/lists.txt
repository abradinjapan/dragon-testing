List insert implementation in Dragon steps:
    1) Check to see if the underlying buffer needs to be expanded.
        - Check if the data buffer plus the content buffer sizes exceeds the allocation buffer end.
        - Then allocate the new buffer if necessary.
    2) Setup pointers for copying.
    3) Copy buffer from end to start.
        - Copy the end half of the buffer.
        - Copy the data into the new buffer.
        - Copy the start half of the buffer if a new allocation was made.
    4) If necessary, deallocate old buffer.
    5) Update list.
