Things that need to be improved:
    - Type aliases need to be implemented.
    - Constant values somehow are necessary because they take up registers when being passed around in structures.
    - Compilation calls should be able to be inline.
    - Debugging.

Things that work well:
    - Function call IO unanimity.

Tricks that could improve code implementation:
    - A type of argument that allows for any structure / variable type.
    - Lexing files individually while parsing files together on the same loop.
      This instead of parsing files on individual loops.
