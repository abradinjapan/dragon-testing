I get the feeling that some of the power of a programming language comes from creating data and functionality from templates.
When thinking about debugging information, I realized that other entire functions could run before the user code even started in order to create debug information.
Thinking in this style, what other kinds of information could I create around user defined types and functions?
    - Debugging info.
        - Function name.
        - Function IO.
        - Function offsets & scopes.
        - Function variables.
And could this information be used to debug a program live?
    Yes.

I would perfer use json in order to embed debug data, but it comes with the problem of how to properly translate buffers.
    A buffer written in json could be a few things.
        - An ascii/utf-8 string.
        - Two pointers.
        - A buffer of bytes.
    How to specify when serializing and deserializing what format is which?
        Tags.
